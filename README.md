# AzerothCore
This is the content I use with my World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King server. The core I use is [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

The server is not public, only I play on it and I multibox so things like having group-looted quest items is a must. I use the Bash scripts to manage the server on a few Proxmox Containers running Ubuntu 20.10. The Authserver and Worldserver are run separately so the script is split into two. I also have a few containers specifically for MySQL-databases. They can technically be used on a single machine with some finagling or combined into one for easier use.

All respect goes to the amazing people developing the core for us to use.

Everyone is free to use this content for themselves or any public server, but I do not want anyone to take credit for creating it.
